The Repl "RUN" button doesn't work.

To run, open a console (or shell and do):
* "bundle exec jekyll serve --host 0.0.0.0"
* a "webview" should appear
* enjoy :)

MORE NOTES:
* may need to run `gem install bundler:2.3.22` when repl restarts
* then `bundle install`
* then `bundle exec jekyll serve --host 0.0.0.0
